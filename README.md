### Conflict Resolution

- What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?

James: We will meet and discuss this. If other teammates are not able to contribute due to external forces, we will take it to the higher ups and discuss how to divide workload.

James: We will try to keep it inclusive and assign tasks based on skill level and availability. 

- How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

James: We can take certain times of the day to discuss application features or code to better understand something we do not comprehend fully.
